THBS1 in macrophage-derived exosomes exacerbates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by inducing ferroptosis in endothelial cells.,"Macrophages play a critical role in the development of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a pivotal pathological process that exacerbates AIS, with exosomes act as crucial mediators. However, the effects and mechanisms of action of macrophage-derived exosomes on CIRI remain unclear. This study demonstrated that macrophage-derived exosomes induce endothelial ferroptosis and barrier disruption during CIRI. Through proteomic sequencing and the reanalysis of transcriptomic and single-cell sequencing data, thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) was identified as a key exosomal molecule. Elevated THBS1 was observed in exosomes and monocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with AIS in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-stimulated THP-1 and RAW264.7, in their secreted exosomes, and in macrophages within the brains of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mice. Additionally, THBS1 expression in exosomes was positively correlated with vascular barrier injury biomarkers, including MMP-9 and S100B. Modulation of THBS1 in macrophage-derived exosomes affected exosome-induced ferroptosis in endothelial cells. The mechanism by which THBS1 binds directly to OTUD5 and promotes GPX4 ubiquitination was elucidated using RNA interference, adeno-associated virus transfection, and endothelial-specific Gpx4 knockout mice. High-throughput screening of small-molecule compounds targeting THBS1 was performed. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and cellular thermal shift assays further confirmed that salvianolic acid B (SAB) has a potent binding affinity for THBS1. SAB treatment inhibited the interaction between THBS1 and OTUD5, leading to reduced GPX4 ubiquitination. Further research revealed that SAB treatment enhanced the cerebral protective effects of THBS1 inhibition. In conclusion, this study explored the role of exosome-mediated signaling between macrophages and cerebral vascular endothelial cells in CIRI, highlighting the THBS1-OTUD5-GPX4 axis as a driver of endothelial ferroptosis and brain injury. Targeting this signaling axis represents a potential therapeutic strategy for treating CIRI.","Liu, Sui, Li, Sun, Li, Chen, Ma, Cao, Xi",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12974-025-03382-x

"Therapeutic effects of quercetin in oral cancer therapy: a systematic review of preclinical evidence focused on oxidative damage, apoptosis and anti-metastasis.","Oral malignancies are among the common head and neck cancers. Various therapeutic modalities are used for targeting oral cancers. It was shown that quercetin (a flavonoid) has an anti-cancer effect on different cancers. In the current study, the anti-cancer potentials of quercetin against oral cancer cells were summarized.
The current systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guideline for the identification of relevant studies in various electronic databases up to April 2023. After reviewing and screening 193 articles, 18 were chosen for this study based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria.
It was shown that quercetin significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation, cell viability, tumor volume, invasion, metastasis and migration. This anti-cancer agent induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the cancer cells. Quercetin treatment could also induce some biochemical alterations in the cancer cells.
According to the results, it can be mentioned that quercetin administration has an anti-cancer effect against oral cancer cells. This agent exerts its anticancer effects via reduced cell viability and different mechanisms, including induce oxidative damage, apoptosis, and reduced invasion and metastasis. However, suggesting the use of quercetin as a therapeutic agent of oral cancer patients requires further clinical studies due to its poor absorption rates, and the exact molecular mechanisms are still not well understood.","Saadh, Ahmed, Chandra, Al-Hussainy, Hamid, Mishra, Taher, Alwan, Jawad, Al-Nuaimi, Alsaikhan, Farhood, Akhavan-Sigari",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12935-025-03694-1

Mechanisms of antigen-dependent resistance to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies.,"Cancer immunotherapy has reshaped the landscape of cancer treatment over the past decades. Genetic manipulation of T cells to express synthetic receptors, known as chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), has led to the creation of tremendous commercial and therapeutic success for the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies. However, since the engagement of CAR-T cells with their respective antigens is solely what triggers their cytotoxic reactions against target cells, the slightest changes to the availability and/or structure of the target antigen often result in the incapacitation of CAR-T cells to enforce tumoricidal responses. This results in the resistance of tumor cells to a particular CAR-T cell therapy that requires meticulous heeding to sustain remissions in cancer patients. In this review, we highlight the antigen-dependent resistance mechanisms by which tumor cells dodge being recognized and targeted by CAR-T cells. Moreover, since substituting the target antigen is the most potent strategy for overcoming antigen-dependent disease relapse, we tend to highlight the current status of some target antigens that might be considered suitable alternatives to the currently available antigens in various cancers. We also propose target antigens whose targeting might reduce the off-tumor adverse events of CAR-T cells in certain malignancies.","Nasiri, Safarzadeh Kozani, Salem, Mahboubi Kancha, Dashti Shokoohi, Safarzadeh Kozani",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12935-025-03697-y

"Analysis of pain prognosis, medication efficacy, treatment willingness and influencing factors in patients with burning mouth syndrome: a cross-sectional survey.","To explore the pain prognosis, medication efficacy and treatment willingness of patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and to identify the factors influencing the pain prognosis, medication efficacy and treatment willingness of patients with BMS.
Medical records of patients who were clinically diagnosed with BMS and who complained of oral mucosal pain at the Department of Stomatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, were retrospectively collected from January 2019 to April 2022. Telephone follow-ups were conducted in August 2024 to investigate the patients' pain prognosis, medication efficacy, willingness for treatment and related treatment information.
Among the 192 patients, only 31.77% (61/192) reported complete elimination of pain; 37.50% (72/192) reported that the pain still existed but had improved, and 30.73% (59/192) reported no improvement at all. A total of 31.25% (60/192), 34.90% (67/192), and 32.81% (63/192) of the BMS patients evaluated medication efficacy as significantly effective, effective, or ineffective, respectively. Among the 131 patients who still had pain symptoms, 38.17% (50/131) intended to continue treatment. Logistic regression revealed that patients who were older (P = 0.023), who had visited multiple hospitals for treatment (P = 0.001), who were afraid of cancer (P = 0.011) and who were prone to anxiety or depression (P < 0.001) had poorer pain improvement. Patients who had visited multiple hospitals (P < 0.001) and those who were prone to anxiety or depression (P < 0.001) had significantly lower evaluations of medication efficacy. Males (P = 0.041) and those who had visited multiple hospitals (P < 0.001) were more willing to continue treatment.
The prognosis for most BMS patients tends to be relatively poor. Age, anxiety or depression, and fear of cancer may affect the pain prognosis of patients with BMS, whereas psychological factors may also impact the efficacy of medication.","Zhang, Tan, Ma, Guo, Yang",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12903-025-05674-3

DCLK1-mediated regulation of invadopodia dynamics and matrix metalloproteinase trafficking drives invasive progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"HNSCC presents a significant health challenge due to its high mortality resulting from treatment resistance and locoregional invasion into critical structures in the head and neck region. Understanding the invasion mechanisms of HNSCC has the potential to guide targeted therapies, improving patient survival. Previously, we demonstrated the involvement of doublecortin like kinase 1 (DCLK1) in regulating HNSCC cell invasion. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that DCLK1 modulates proteins within invadopodia, specialized subcellular protrusions that secrete matrix metalloproteinases to degrade the ECM.
We employed tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics to identify the role of DCLK1 in regulating proteins involved in HNSCC invasion and validated the findings using immunoblotting. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was interrogated to correlate DCLK1 expression with tumor stage, grade, and invasion-associated proteins. In vitro invasion was assessed using a Boyden chamber assay, and immunohistochemistry on patient samples determined DCLK1's distribution within tumors. Gelatin invadopodia assay was used to establish DCLK1 localization to invadopodia related gelatin degradation. Super-resolution confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalization of DCLK1 with invadopodia markers and MMP trafficking proteins. ECM degradation by MMPs in HNSCC cells with wild-type and knockdown DCLK1 was evaluated using a dye-quenched tracer, while gel zymography and MMP array identified secreted proteases. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm interactions between DCLK1, MMP9, KIF16B, and RAB40B.
Proteomic analysis demonstrate DCLK1's role in regulating proteins involved in cytoskeletal and ECM remodeling. Clinically, rising DCLK1 levels correlate with higher histological grade and lymph node metastasis, with heightened expression observed at the leading edge of HNSCC patient tissue. DCLK1 is localized with markers of mature invadopodia including TKS4, TKS5, cortactin, and MT1-MMP. Knockdown of DCLK1 led to reductions in invadopodia numbers and decreased in vitro invasion and ECM degradation. MMP9 colocalizes with DCLK1 within invadopodia structures and its secretion is disrupted by DCLK1 knockdown. Further, PLA and co-immunoprecipitations studies demonstrate DLCK1 complexes with KIF16B and RAB40B enabling trafficking of degradative MMP9 cargo along the invadopodia to degrade local ECM.
This work unveils a novel function of DCLK1 in regulating KIF16B and RAB40B to traffic matrix degrading MMP9 cargo to the distal end of the invadopodia facilitating HNSCC invasion.","Arnold, Yap, Farrokhian, Jackson, Barry, Ly, Arjunan, Kaczorowski-Worthley, Tews, Pandey, Morrison, Washburn, Standing, Gomez, Yellapu, Johnson, Li, Umar, Anant, Thomas",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12943-025-02264-3

Spatial transcriptomic analysis of tumor microenvironment in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with HIV infection.,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the most prevalent viruses, causing significant immune depletion in affected individuals. Current treatments can control HIV and prolong patients' lives, but new challenges have emerged. Increasing incidence of cancers occur in HIV patients. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers observed in HIV patients. However, the spatial cellular characteristics of HIV-related ESCC have not been explored, and the differences between HIV-ESCC and typical ESCC remain unclear.
We performed spatial transcriptome sequencing on HIV-ESCC samples to depict the microenvironment and employed cell communication analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence to investigate the molecular mechanism in HIV-ESCC.
We found that HIV-ESCC exhibited a unique cellular composition, with fibroblasts and epithelial cells intermixed throughout the tumor tissue, lacking obvious spatial separation, while other cell types were sparse. Besides, HIV-ESCC exhibited an immune desert phenotype, characterized by a low degree of immune cell infiltration, with only a few SPP1
Our findings depict the spatial microenvironment of HIV-ESCC and elucidate a molecular mechanism in the progression of HIV-ESCC. This will provide us insights into the molecular basis of HIV-ESCC and potential treatment strategies.","Zuo, Jin, Li, Ming, Fan, Pan, Yao, Peng",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12943-025-02248-3

RSL3-loaded nanoparticles amplify the therapeutic potential of cold atmospheric plasma.,"Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has exhibited exciting potential for cancer treatment. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), the primary constituents in CAP, contribute to cancer cell death by elevating oxidative stress in cells. However, several intrinsic cellular antioxidant defense systems exist, such as the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) enzyme, which dampens the cell-killing efficacy of CAP. RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3), also known as a ferroptosis inducer, is a synthetic GPX4 inhibitor. Therefore, we hypothesized that RSL3 can amplify CAP-induced cell death by inhibition of GPX4. In this study, we showed that RSL3 loaded in poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles can enhance CAP-induced cell deaths in 4T1 tumor cells. Furthermore, the combination of CAP and RSL3 also promoted cancer immunogenic cell death (ICD), induced dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and macrophage polarization, initiating tumor-specific T-cell mediated immune responses against tumors. For in vivo application, RSL3@NP was co-delivered with CAP via injectable Pluronic hydrogel. In 4T1-bearing mice, hydrogel-mediated delivery of CAP and RSL3-loaded nanoparticles can effectively elicit potent anti-tumor immune responses and inhibit tumor growth.","Cao, Chen, Fang, Deng, Wang, Wang, Chen, Chen",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12951-025-03211-6

Identification of CSRP1 as novel biomarker for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer by the combination of clinical and functional research.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second most common malignancy and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. A critical challenge lies in accurately identifying those patients at high risk for transitioning rapidly from hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) to lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). In our study, we employed a multiomics approach involving bioinformatics analysis on datasets GSE2443 and GSE35988, along with proteomics studies, to discover that cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1 (CSRP1) expression significantly impacts the progression of HSPC. This hypothesis was substantiated through experiments using PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, where we conducted scratch assays and apoptosis assays, all of which confirmed CSRP1's role in suppressing tumor growth. Furthermore, we elucidated the inhibitory effect of CSRP1 on tumors by performing xenograft experiments on castrated mice models. To solidify these findings in a clinical context, we constructed a nomogram model integrating CSRP1's immunohistochemistry data and clinical parameters from an actual patient cohort with HSPC. This model revealed that low CSRP1 expression indeed promotes the advancement towards CRPC. In conclusion, the level of CSRP1 expression can serve as a valuable biomarker for clinicians to predict disease progression in their patients. It has the potential to guide personalized clinical management and decision-making strategies, thereby contributing to more effective and targeted treatment approaches for HSPC patients.","Pan, Wang, He, Yang",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12935-025-03708-y

The impact of combining cetuximab with the traditional chemotherapy regimens on clinical effectiveness in metastatic colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) poses a high rate of morbidity and mortality despite various treatment advances. Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR, has shown promising efficacy in improving outcomes when combined with chemotherapy. Understanding its efficacy is essential for optimizing treatment strategies in mCRC. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of combining cetuximab with chemotherapy in mCRC.
PubMed and Google Scholar were systematically searched following the benchmarks indicated by PRISMA. The primary outcomes of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Statistical analyses were executed using Stata version 16.
The meta-analysis encompassed 25 studies involving 3788 mCRC patients. The median age spans from 18 to 77 years. The cetuximab plus chemotherapy exhibited a higher PFS and OS with a significant difference (PFS: HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63-0.96, p < 0.01, I
Combining cetuximab with chemotherapy offers a potential benefit in improving survival outcomes for metastatic colorectal cancer patients, as indicated by this study. These results suggest that cetuximab may be a valuable addition to mCRC treatment strategies, warranting further clinical investigation and integration into standard care.","Azeem, Ur Rehman, Rasheed, Shahzad, Javed, Jamil, Karuniawati, Al-Tamimi",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12885-025-13515-3

Dynamic changes in immune repertoire profiles in patients with stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer during consolidation treatment with immunotherapy.,"One-year of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a standard of care. The precise predictive biomarkers are under investigations either immunological markers or clinical characteristics. Here, we explored immune repertoire of T cell receptor β-chain (TCRβ) during ICI treatment.
During August 2019 and September 2021, stage III NSCLC, post CCRT patients from Ramathibodi Hospital was enrolled. All patients were treated by durvalumab after CCRT. Blood samples were collected together with clinical data and tumor assessment every 3-4 months until disease progression or discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events. CDR3 region and TCRΒ polymorphisms was explored by RNA sequencing using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) TCR beta short-read assay. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to analyze clonal diversity, TCR convergence frequency and the Shannon diversity from each timepoint. Immune repertoire and clinical correlation were explored using Spearman's correlation and Pearson's correlation. RStudio software version 2021 build 372 was used for analyses. A significance level was at P < 0.05.
Forty-four blood samples from 12 patients were analyzed. Mean duration of durvalumab treatment was 284 days. After durvalumab treatment, increasing of TCR convergence frequency was found compared to baseline (R = 0.36). Interestingly, it was also significantly higher in non-progressive disease (non-PD) patients compared with progressive disease (PD) patients (P = 0.011). Furthermore, Shannon diversity was higher increasing in PD patients compared with non-PD patients. Taken together, our study found that increasing of TCR convergence with less T-cell diversity in non-PD patients probably demonstrated a T cell-specific clonal expansion response to durvalumab treatment in this population.
TCRβ repertoire is the potential biomarker for predicting durvalumab treatment response in post CCRT stage III NSCLC patients. However, a larger cohort with long-read assay should be explored.","Iemwimangsa, Anantaya, Oranratnachai, Thamrongjirapat, Lumjiaktase, Teoh, Khiewngam, Monnamo, Sanvarinda, Incharoen, Charoenyingwattan, Sensorn, Dejthevaporn, Sirachainan, Chantratita, Reungwetwattana, Trachu",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12885-025-13716-w

PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy or lenvatinib in advanced gallbladder cancer: a retrospective comparative study.,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a refractory primary cancer. Some GBC patients are prone to recurrence even after surgical resection. In such cases, chemotherapy is the most common non-surgical treatment. The emergence of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors and targeted therapy have provided an additional option for those suffering from advanced tumors.
This was a retrospective study involving patients with advanced GBC treated at the Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital between June 2019 and June 2022. The patients who received a PD-1 inhibitor (tislelizumab) with chemotherapy or with lenvatinib were retrospectively analyzed. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) was used as the efficacy evaluation standard. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and tumor marker CA199 were evaluated.
This study involved 61 patients with advanced GBC. Of these, 32 patients received tislelizumab and GS (gemcitabine and TS-1) chemotherapy, whereas 29 patients received tislelizumab and lenvatinib. For the Tislelizumab plus GS chemotherapy group, the median OS and PFS were 19.64 ± 11.81 (95% CI: 16.47-25.20) and 15.44 ± 13.42 (95% CI: 12.08-22.25) months, respectively. For the lenvatinib group, the OS and PFS were 13.06 ± 9.41 (95% CI: 9.72-16.63) and 10.34 ± 10.03 (95% CI: 6.56-14.13) months, respectively. The ORR and DCR were 59.38% and 81.3%, respectively, for the Tislelizumab plus GS chemotherapy group, which were significantly longer than those for the Tislelizumab plus Lenvatinib group. Treatment-related adverse events were similar between the groups.
Tislelizumab combined with GS chemotherapy provides a safe and more efficient treatment option for advanced GBC patients.","Ma, Tai, Song",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12876-025-03688-3

Establishment and evaluation of a predictive model for immune reconstitution in people living with HIV after antiretroviral therapy.,"Achieving complete immune reconstitution (CIR) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) following antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for preventing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression and improving survival. However, there is a paucity of robust prediction models for determining the likelihood of CIR in PLWH after ART. We aimed to develop and validate a CIR prediction model utilizing baseline data.
Baseline data including demographic information, immunological profiles, and routine laboratory test results, were collected from PLWH in Yunnan, China. Baseline referred to the first recorded results after HIV diagnosis but before initiating ART, and these initial measurements served as the baseline data for analysis. The participants were divided into training and validation sets (7:3 ratio). To construct the model and accompanying nomogram, univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed. The model was evaluated using the C-index, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and clinical decision curves to assess discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability.
Five thousand four hundred eight PLWH were included, with a CIR of 38.52%. Cox regression analysis revealed various independent factors associated with CIR, including infection route, baseline CD4
This study successfully developed a prediction model with robust performance. This model has considerable potential to aid clinicians in tailoring treatment strategies, which could enhance outcomes and quality of life for PLWH.","Li, Li, Zheng, He, Duan, Li, Tian, Li, Dong, Shen, Zheng",2025-02-25,"10.1186/s12879-025-10673-4

Mantle Cell Lymphoma: what clinical progress in the last 5 years?,"Mantle cell lymphomais still a lymphoma subtype with productive clinical research. Recent published data on Bruton kinase inhibitors have changed the managementof patients.
This review summarizes the mostimportant trials evaluating the differenttreatment options in mantle cell lymphoma in the frontline and the relapsed/refractorysetting in young and older patients, focusing on the role of Bruton kinaseinhibitors in improving disease outcome and omitting consolidative autologous stemcell transplantation.
Followingthe results of the TRIANGLE trial, the addition of ibrutinib to the inductionand maintenance treatment should be considered and the omission of autologousstem cell transplantation is questionable in all patients. Minimal residualdisease is a promising biomarker that would dictate our decision makingespecially in the maintenance setting.

Global patterns and trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality across 185 countries.,"Updates of current and projected estimates of the burden are critical to monitoring the success of ongoing efforts in breast cancer control, such as the World Health Organization Global Breast Cancer Initiative, which aims to reduce breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year. We investigated the current (2022) and future (2050) global burden of female breast cancer overall, and by age group, in 185 countries using the GLOBOCAN database, and 10-year trends in incidence and mortality rates in 50 and 46 countries, respectively, using the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents plus and World Health Organization mortality databases. Globally, 2.3 million new cases and 670,000 deaths from female breast cancer occurred in 2022. Annual rates increased by 1-5% in half of examined countries. Mortality rates decreased in 29 countries with very high Human Development Index (HDI), and seven countries (for example, Belgium and Denmark) are meeting the Global Breast Cancer Initiative goal of at least a 2.5% decrease each year. By 2050, new cases and deaths will have increased by 38% and 68%, respectively, disproportionately impacting low-HDI countries. High-quality cancer and vital status data, and continued progress in early diagnosis and access to treatment, are needed in countries with low and medium HDI to address inequities and monitor cancer control goals.","Kim, Harper, McCormack, Sung, Houssami, Morgan, Mutebi, Garvey, Soerjomataram, Fidler-Benaoudia",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41591-025-03502-3

The cellular and molecular cardiac tissue responses in human inflammatory cardiomyopathies after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination.,"Myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can have multiple etiologies, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or, rarely, mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from patients with myocarditis unrelated to COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19), after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Post-COVID-19) and after COVID-19 vaccination (Post-Vaccination). We identified distinct cytokine expression patterns, with interferon-γ playing a key role in Post-COVID-19, and upregulated IL16 and IL18 expression serving as a hallmark of Post-Vaccination myocarditis.

Circadian clock features define novel subtypes among breast cancer cells and shape drug sensitivity.,"The circadian clock regulates key physiological processes, including cellular responses to DNA damage. Circadian-based therapeutic strategies optimize treatment timing to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, offering potential for precision cancer treatment. However, applying these strategies in cancer remains limited due to a lack of understanding of the clock's function across cancer types and incomplete insights into how the circadian clock affects drug responses. To address this, we conducted deep circadian phenotyping across a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Observing diverse circadian dynamics, we characterized metrics to assess circadian rhythm strength and stability in vitro. This led to the identification of four distinct circadian-based phenotypes among 14 breast cancer cell models: functional, weak, unstable, and dysfunctional clocks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the circadian clock plays a critical role in shaping pharmacological responses to various anti-cancer drugs and we identify circadian features descriptive of drug sensitivity. Collectively, our findings establish a foundation for implementing circadian-based treatment strategies in breast cancer, leveraging clock phenotypes and drug sensitivity patterns to optimize therapeutic outcomes.","Ector, Didier, De Landtsheer, Nordentoft, Schmal, Keilholz, Herzel, Kramer, Sauter, Granada",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s44320-025-00092-7

The economic burden of Myasthenia gravis from the patient´s perspective and reflected in German claims data.,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disorder resulting in exertion-dependent muscle fatigability. Affecting all age groups MG is a chronic disease with unpredictable fluctuations and a range of symptom expression which can require costly immunosuppressive therapy and intensive care critically influencing economic burden. Here we aim to elucidate both the personal and societal economic burden of MG. Data were used from two sources: (1) a cross sectional study of MG patients registered in the German Myasthenia Society (DMG) collected by a survey in 2019 (n = 1660), and (2) from a dataset provided by a German health insurance company covering the period from 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2019 (n = 750) and categorized to similar subgroups for comparison. Individual and societal economic burden was highest in patients with intensified medical treatment. Absence days from work per patient year in the first year after index in claims data were 67.1 days (95% CI 66.1-68.2) (referring to n = 260 non-retired patients). Of 686 patients with early onset (< 50 years) MG 260 (41.2%) reported loss of income due to MG in DMG data. Average inpatient costs from claims data in patients with intensified treatment (38,669€; 95% CI 38,627-38,712€) were particularly high compared with standard treatment (2980€; 95% CI 2975-2986€) and to no MG-related treatment (887€; 95% CI 877-886€). MG represents a major economic burden for the individual and the health care system. The costs are positively associated with the severity of disease. The economic burden is particularly high for working patients. UCB Pharma provided financial support for the subanalysis, but was not involved in the design of the study.Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03979521, submitted: June 7, 2019, first patient enrolled: May 1, 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03979521 .","Lehnerer, Herdick, Mevius, Grittner, Gansel, Joeres, Biskup, Meisel",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-91372-7

Mesenchymal stem cells modulate breast cancer progression through their secretome by downregulating ten-eleven translocation 1.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as crucial players within the tumor microenvironment (TME), contributing through their paracrine secretome. Depending on the context, the MSC-derived secretome can either support or inhibit tumor growth. This study investigates the role of MSC-derived secretome in modulating breast cancer (BC) cell behavior, with a focus on ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1), a DNA demethylase with known oncogenic properties in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We first isolated and characterized human bone marrow-derived MSCs, and then assessed the impact of their secretome on BC cells. Treatment with the MSC-derived secretome significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 BC cell lines, resulting in reduced cell viability and migration rates compared to control cells. Western blot analyses revealed downregulation of Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, along with decreased expression of N-cadherin and increased expression of E-cadherin, indicating potential inhibition of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Differential gene expression analyses highlighted TET1 as significantly upregulated in TNBC tissues compared to normal samples. Further experiments confirmed that the MSC-derived secretome downregulated TET1 expression in BC cells, as evidenced by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. To explore TET1's functional role, we silenced TET1 with siRNAs, observing cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis-effects that mirrored those seen with MSC-secretome treatment. Notably, TET1 knockdown also increased MDA-MB-231 cell sensitivity to cisplatin, suggesting a role for TET1 in chemoresistance. These findings provide insight into the ability of MSCs to modulate BC cell progression through their secretome, highlighting the involvement of TET1 downregulation in inhibiting BC cell progression and enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity. The MSC-derived secretome thus holds promise as an innovative, cell-free therapeutic approach in BC treatment.","Motamed, Jabbari, Sheikhbahaei, Ghazimoradi, Ghodsi, Jahangir, Habibi, Babashah",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-91314-3

Synapsin III promotes neuronal-like transdifferentiation of glioblastoma stem cells by disrupting JAG1-Notch1 interaction.,"Glioblastoma (GBM), a formidable and highly aggressive form of brain cancer, is predominantly driven by GBM stem cells (GSCs), which are characterized by their ability for self-renewal and aberrant differentiation. Targeting the terminal differentiation of GSCs represents a promising therapeutic strategy. This study aimed to elucidate the role of synapsin III (SYN3) in driving the differentiation of GSCs into neuron-like cells and its effect on the tumor-suppressive pathways in GBM.
Proliferation assays, limited dilution assays, immunocytochemistry, western blot, RT-qPCR, and GSC tumor models were used to determine gene function and assess the role of γ-secretase inhibitors. Co-immunoprecipitation and microscale thermophoresis were conducted to explore the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Intracranial orthotopic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) was performed to evaluate therapeutic potential.
We demonstrate that SYN3, uniquely within the synapsin family, acts as a tumor suppressor by steering GSCs toward neuronal-like transdifferentiation. Mechanistically, SYN3 enhances the expression of Neuregulin 3 (NRG3), which serves as a non-canonical antagonist of Notch signaling by competitively binding to specific epitopes within the EGF-like domain of JAG1, a critical site for the canonical engagement of Notch receptors. This critical interaction disrupts the JAG1-Notch1 signaling pathway, a key mechanism driving GSCs toward neuronal-like transdifferentiation, thereby reducing their stemness. Furthermore, SYN3 demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity in a mouse model harboring GSCs. AAV-mediated overexpression of SYN3 markedly impeded GBM progression.
Our research reveals the therapeutic potential of SYN3 in regulating GSC fate and offers a novel differentiation-based approach for GBM therapy.","Deng, Yuan, Jin, Wang, Gong, Ren, Park, Shi, Yin",2025-02-25,10.1093/neuonc/noaf056

On-patient medical record and mRNA therapeutics using intradermal microneedles.,"Medical interventions often require timed series of doses, thus necessitating accurate medical record-keeping. In many global settings, these records are unreliable or unavailable at the point of care, leading to less effective treatments or disease prevention. Here we present an invisible-to-the-naked-eye on-patient medical record-keeping technology that accurately stores medical information in the patient skin as part of microneedles that are used for intradermal therapeutics. We optimize the microneedle design for both a reliable delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and the near-infrared fluorescent microparticles that encode the on-patient medical record-keeping. Deep learning-based image processing enables encoding and decoding of the information with excellent temporal and spatial robustness. Long-term studies in a swine model demonstrate the safety, efficacy and reliability of this approach for the co-delivery of on-patient medical record-keeping and the mRNA vaccine encoding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This technology could help healthcare workers make informed decisions in circumstances where reliable record-keeping is unavailable, thus contributing to global healthcare equity.","Han, Kanelli, Liu, Daristotle, Pardeshi, Forster, Karchin, Folk, Murmann, Tostanoski, Carrasco, Alsaiari, Wang, Tran, Zhang, Eshaghi, Levy, Pyon, Sloane, Lin, Lau, Perkinson, Bawendi, Barouch, Durand, Langer, Jaklenec",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41563-024-02115-4

Cyclin E1 overexpression sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to WEE1 and PLK1 inhibition.,"Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) amplification is associated with poor prognosis of ovarian carcinomas across histological subtypes. Inhibitors targeting PLK1 or WEE1 are emerging as promising therapeutic agents for cancer treatment that disrupt the critical G2/M checkpoint, leading to cancer cell death. However, biomarkers that predict the response to these inhibitors are not well defined. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the PLK1 inhibitor, volasertib, and the WEE1 inhibitor, adavosertib, along with the biomarker potential of cyclin E1 in ovarian cancer cells. Both inhibitors suppressed the proliferation of cyclin E1-overexpressing cells to a greater extent than that of cells exhibiting low cyclin E1 expression. TP53 silencing did not increase the sensitivity to these inhibitors. In cyclin E1-overexpressing cells, PLK1 inhibition reduced the proportion of cells in the G1 phase and increased those in the G2/M and sub-G1 phases. WEE1 inhibition reduced G1 phase cells without a clear peak in the S-G2/M phase and increased the sub-G1 phase cells. Both inhibitors suppressed the growth of cyclin E1-overexpressing tumors in vivo. Taken together, cyclin E1 overexpression, regardless of TP53 status, may serve as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of these inhibitors, offering potential personalized treatment strategies for ovarian cancer.","Xi, Kunita, Ogawa, Ka, Tanimoto, Tsuchimochi, Nagai, Matsunaga, Fukuda, Watanabe, Sone, Shinozaki-Ushiku, Kawana, Ushiku, Osuga, Katayama, Kage, Oda",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41388-025-03312-4

Ixazomib or Lenalidomide combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in the treatment of elderly transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.,"Oral-drug based regimens are useful in certain circumstances for transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (TI-NDMM), but few studies have compared Ixazomib based regimen with lenalidomide based regimen head-to-head. We carried out a prospective randomized, open, parallel group trial in patients with TI-NDMM in 3 China centers from March 2020 to December 2022. Sixty-three patients were available for final analysis, ICd (Ixazomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone, n = 31) and RCd (lenalidomide/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone, n = 32). The primary objective was to compare the two regimens by analyzing the overall response rate (ORR), safety profiles, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We also explored clinical and the biological characteristics of the patients with primary drug resistance. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between ICd and RCd groups, with the median age 70 vs. 70 years; 12.9% vs. 12.5% of patients had stage III disease; 25.8% vs. 28.1% had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. The overall response rate (ORR) at the end of 4 cycles was 87.1% vs. 71.9% (odds ratio [OR], 1.212; 95% CI, 0.938-1.565; P = 0.213); the best ≥ VGPR rate was 41.9% vs. 31.2% (OR, 1.342; 95% CI 0.694-2.597; P = 0.439). Among high-risk cytogenetic patients, ORR was higher in the ICd group, 75% vs. 55.5% (P = 0.620), respectively. After 35 months follow-up, the median PFS were 22 and 23 months between ICd and RCd groups (P = 0.897). Median OS was not reached, estimated 3-year OS rate was 86.4% vs. 85.4% (P = 0.774). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (6.5% in the ICd group vs. 31.3% in the RCd group), anemia (19.4% vs. 18.8%), pneumonia (0 vs. 15.6%) and diarrhea (12.9% vs. 0). Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) induced dose reduction and discontinuation were 22.6% vs. 37.5% and 3.2% vs. 6.3% in the ICd vs. RCd group, respectively. Exploration data showed that patients with t (4;14) were insensitive to initial RCd treatment. The ICd regimen showed a tendency towards improved ORR compared to RCd regimen. Both ICd and RCd regimens demonstrated less dose reduction and treatment discontinuation, suggesting their tolerability and feasibility for older individuals with TI-NDMM.Trial registration: This study was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR).

Pan-cancer analysis uncovered the prognostic and therapeutic value of disulfidptosis.,"Disulfidptosis, a newly discovered cell death mode distinct from other programmed cell death in lung and kidney cancer cells, is defined as extensive disulfide bonds to actin cytoskeleton proteins, leading to actin contraction and cytoskeletal disruption cell death. New cell death pattern discoveries often drive advances in tumor research. Therefore, the present study attempted to decipher the manifestation and importance of disulfidptosis in pan-cancer. Combining Clinical specimen immunofluorescence staining, single-cell analyses, and spatial transcriptome analyses, we demonstrated the manifestation of disulfidptosis in pan-cancer. Multi-omics analysis has revealed that genomic variants and DNA methylation in DRGs can affect the prognosis of patients with pan-cancer. The nomogram based on the DRGs Score model could accurately predict the prognosis of patients with pan-cancer. PF-562271, EHT-1864, and IPA-3 are potential therapeutic agents targeting disulfidptosis. Collectively, this study deciphered for the first time the importance of disulfidptosis for pan-cancer and developed the DRGs Score model that can assist clinicians in accurately predicting the prognosis and guiding individualized treatment of pan-cancer patients.","Zhang, Li, Lu, Jiang, Song, Ye, Gu, Chen, Shang",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41698-025-00834-8

Metformin modulates FJX1 via upregulation of Hsa-miR-1306-3p to suppress colon adenocarcinoma viability.,"Metformin, widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has recently gained attention for its potential anticancer properties. Several studies have shown that metformin treatment inhibits cell viability in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD); however, the research related to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage is limited. As COAD is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, understanding the genetic factors that regulate the pathogenesis of COAD at each TNM stage and the effects of metformin for potential treatment. Therefore, we identified differentially expressed factors at the TNM stage in metformin-treated COAD cells and investigated their regulatory mechanisms using microRNAs (miRNAs). Through bioinformatics analyses, four-jointed box kinase 1 (FJX1) and hsa-miR-1306-3p were identified as differentially expressed in COAD upon metformin treatment. Metformin treatment significantly reduced cell viability, with an observed decrease of approximately 50%. Analysis using quantitative real-time PCR showed an increase in hsa-miR-1306-3p and a decrease in FJX1 expression upon metformin treatment compared to untreated cells. Luciferase assay confirmed the sequence-specific binding of hsa-miR-1306-3p to FJX1. These findings highlight the potential of metformin as a therapeutic agent for COAD by modulating FJX1 expression via upregulation of hsa-miR-1306-3p, revealing novel avenues for COAD treatment.","Kim, Shin, Kim, Park, Lee, Lee, Jeong, Roh, Kwon, Choi, Leem, Kim",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-91022-y

Tripartite motif-containing protein 26 promotes colorectal cancer growth by inactivating p53.,"Tripartite motif-containing protein 26 (TRIM26) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that exhibits divergent roles in various cancer types (oncogenic and anti-oncogenic). This study investigates the interaction of TRIM26 with the tumor suppressor protein p53 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells by performing a comprehensive set of biochemical, cell-based assays, and xenograft experiments. As a result, we found that overexpression of TRIM26 significantly enhances CRC cell proliferation and colony formation, while knockdown of TRIM26 suppresses these processes. Xenograft experiments further validated the tumor-promoting role of TRIM26 in CRC. Supporting this is that TRIM26 is highly expressed in human CRC tissues as revealed by our analysis of the TCGA database. Biochemically, TRIM26 directly bound to the C-terminus of p53 and facilitated its ubiquitination, resulting in proteolytic degradation and attenuated p53 activity independently of MDM2. Also, TRIM26 increased the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 by binding to MDM2's C-terminus. This study uncovers the oncogenic potential of TRIM26 in CRC by inhibiting p53 function. Through its ubiquitin ligase activity, TRIM26 destabilizes p53, consequently promoting CRC cell proliferation and tumor growth. These findings shed light on the complex involvement of TRIM26 in cancer and identify this ubiquitin ligase as a potential therapeutic target for future development of CRC treatment.","Tan, Ko, Naji, Zhu, Wang, Huang, Zhang, Zeng, Lu",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41418-025-01463-1

Tuberculosis after hematopoietic cell transplantation: retrospective study on behalf of the infectious diseases working party of the EBMT.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is rare following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In this multinational retrospective study, we report the frequency, characteristics, and outcome of TB following HCT performed during 2000-2019. Fifty-two patients (35 (67%) males, 15 (29%) children) from 24 centers developed TB following allogeneic (n = 47) or autologous (n = 5) HCT; with the relative frequency of 0.21% and 0.025%, respectively. Forty (77%) were bacteriologically, 12 (23%) clinically confirmed. The median time from HCT to TB was 135 (range, 16-3225) days. Eighteen (35%) patients with extrapulmonary TB (mainly involving lymph nodes and liver/spleen) were significantly younger, developed TB shorter after HCT, more often had inherited underlying disease, and received immunosuppressive therapy at TB diagnosis as compared to pulmonary TB. Five (22%) of 23 patients with drug-susceptibility testing performed, were resistant to at least one anti-TB drug. Treatment success was achieved in 38/50 (76%) of treated patients. One-year overall survival reached 75.7% and the 1-year cumulative incidence of TB-associated death was 18.1%. Concluding, TB is a rare, albeit severe complication, which can develop any time after HCT, frequently involves extrapulmonary sites, and results in high mortality rates. High proportion of drug-resistant TB warrants routine susceptibility testing.","Drozd-Sokołowska, Tridello, Verheggen, Karakukcu, Ben Abdeljelil, Colita, Aljurf, Kröger, Ozturk, Passweg, Gambella, Popova, López Corral, Tanase, Piekarska, Al Zahrani, Ar, Basak, Broers, Carlson, Clark, Faraci, Jindra, Kriván, Ducastelle Lepretre, Mielke, Niederland, Pane, Patrick, Snowden, Yavasoglu, Zecca, Waszczuk-Gajda, Wendel, Knelange, de la Camara, Gil, Mikulska, Averbuch, Styczynski",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41409-025-02530-4

A model for predicting day-100 stem cell transplant-related mortality in AL amyloidosis.,"Autologous stem cell Transplant (ASCT)-related mortality (TRM) in AL amyloidosis remains elevated. AL amyloidosis patients (n = 1718) from 9 centers, transplanted 2003-2020 were included. Pre-ASCT variables of interest were assessed for association with day-100 all-cause mortality. A random forest (RF) classifier with 10-fold cross-validation assisted in variable selection. The final model was fitted using logistic regression. The median age at ASCT was 58 years. Day-100 TRM occurred in 75 patients (4.4%) with the predominant causes being shock, high-grade arrhythmia, and organ failure. Ten factors were associated with day-100 TRM on univariate analysis. RF classifier using these variables generated a model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 ± 0.12. To refine the model selection using importance hierarchy function, a 4-variable model [NT-proBNP/BNP, serum albumin, ECOG performance status (PS), and systolic blood pressure] was built with an AUC of 0.70 ± 0.12. Based on logistic regression coefficients, ECOG PS 2/3 was assigned two points while other adverse predictors 1-point each. The model score range was 0-5, with a day-100 TRM of 0.46%, 3.2%, 5.8%, and 14.5% for 0, 1, 2, and ≥3 points, respectively. This model to predict day-100 TRM in AL amyloidosis allows better-informed decision-making in this heterogeneous disease.","Muchtar, Dispenzieri, Sanchorawala, Hassan, Mwangi, Maurer, Buadi, Lee, Qazilbash, Kin, Zonder, Arai, Chin, Chakraborty, Lentzsch, Magen, Shkury, Sarubbi, Landau, Schönland, Hegenbart, Gertz",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41409-025-02535-z

"Correlation between gut microbiota dysbiosis, metabolic syndrome and breast cancer.","Breast cancer is a widespread cancer with a high death rate globally. The incidence of breast cancer is expected to increase, particularly in low and middle-income countries due to environmental factors and lifestyle changes. Several risk factors, such as age, family history, hormonal and reproductive factors, have been identified to influence breast cancer development. Metabolic syndrome, is a metabolic disorder that has also been linked to breast cancer risk. The gut microbiome has been suggested as one of the environmental factors leading to breast cancer. The human microbiome is mainly colonized in the intestine by various bacterial species, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus and protect the host against pathogenic microorganisms and regulate the immune system. This study included 50 female breast cancer patients and 50 healthy controls with matched ages. Stool fresh samples were taken from test and control groups and stored at - 20 °C until further investigations. DNA of the bacteria in stool samples was extracted using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to check for the bacterial 16s rRNA gene. The exclusion criteria included other malignancies, recent intestinal surgery, infectious diarrhea, prolonged use of antibiotics, substance addiction, and pregnancy or lactation. Our findings exhibited that breast cancer patients had a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome (60%) compared to cancer-free controls (40%). Furthermore, breast cancer patients had significantly lower Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus counts than the controls. No significant difference was found in Streptococcus counts between groups. These findings support the relationship between breast cancer and metabolic syndrome and suggest the potential involvement of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in breast cancer pathophysiology. Our study supports the relation between breast cancer and disorder of metabolic syndrome and suggests the potential involvement of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in breast cancer pathophysiology. Further research is necessary to investigate the complex interactions between genes, the environment, and the gut microbiome in breast cancer development. Understanding these interactions could lead to the progress of novel strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment.","Abdelqader, Mahmoud, Gebreel, Kamel, Abu-Elghait",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-89801-8

Re-examining the optimal extent of lymph node dissection for colon cancer using the lymphadenectomy index.,"The optimal extent of lymph node dissection in colon cancer surgery is specified in guidelines based on the results of past analyses. However, with advances in surgical techniques and multidisciplinary treatments, the clinical significance of dissecting each lymph node may change. In this study, we re-examined the optimal dissection range in each colon cancer localization. We retrospectively analyzed 788 cases of T1-T4 colon cancer who underwent radical resection between 2008 and 2018 at our hospital, and evaluated the Lymphadenectomy Index. No metastases to the main lymph node were found in T1 cases. In T2 cases, dissection effect to the main lymph node were observed in cases with tumors localized in the ascending colon and left side of the transverse colon. For tumors localized in the cecum, dissection was effective for lymph nodes in nodal station 213, in the right side of the transverse colon in station 211, in the descending colon in station 221, and in the sigmoid colon in station 231. These lymph nodes could have been considered out of scope for dissection if the Japanese guidelines were followed. In these cases, the extent of lymph node dissection should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.","Marunaka, Kiuchi, Kuriu, Arita, Shimizu, Nanishi, Imamura, Ohashi, Konishi, Yamamoto, Morimura, Shiozaki, Ikoma, Kubota, Fujiwara, Otsuji",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-91250-2

Association between left atrial function and pulmonary vein stump thrombus after left upper lobectomy: insights from cine-MRI.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate left atrial function using cine-magnetic resonance imaging (cine-MRI) in patients with pulmonary vein stump thrombus (PVST) after left upper lobectomy (LUL). The study population comprised 91 patients (30 with PVST and 61 without PVST) who underwent LUL for pulmonary lesions and evaluation by cine-MRI. Left atrial functional parameters were evaluated and compared between patients with and without the development of PVST after LUL using the Mann-Whitney U test. The diagnostic capabilities of these parameters for predicting PVST development were assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Clinical and left atrial functional parameters were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression models to determine predictors of PVST. Left atrial end-systolic volume (LAESV), left atrial end-diastolic volume (LAEDV), LAESV index (LAESVI), and LAEDV index (LAEDVI) were significantly greater in patients who developed PVST than in those without PVST (p = 0.009, < 0.001, 0.004, and < 0.001, respectively). Left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF) was significantly lower in patients who developed PVST than in those without PVST (p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for predicting PVST was 0.668, 0.769, 0.688, 0.792, and 0.803 for LAESV, LAEDV, LAESVI, LAEDVI, and LAEF, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only LAEF was identified as an independent predictor of PVST (OR 0.896; 95% CI 0.846-0.950). In conclusion, left atrial enlargement and left atrial dysfunction were associated with the development of PVST after LUL.","Takumi, Nagano, Kamimura, Ueda, Umehara, Kamimura, Nakanosono, Nakajo, Kamimura, Kanzaki, Yoshiura",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-91030-y

Ethoxychelerythrine as a potential therapeutic strategy targets PI3K/AKT/mTOR induced mitochondrial apoptosis in the treatment of colorectal cancer.,"Several alkaloids found in the Zanthoxylum genus have demonstrated significant anticancer activity. However, the antitumor effects of Ethoxychelerythrine (Eth) have not been previously reported. Cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, intracellular and reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels of Eth against SW480 cells were evaluated. Subcutaneously transplanted SW480 cells model was used to determine the effect of Eth on tumor growth in vivo. Inflammation levels, angiogenic factors, pathological observations, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), quantitative proteomics, metabolite profiles and western blotting were conducted. It found that Eth significantly inhibited the proliferation of SW480 and HT29 cells in vitro, with stronger inhibitory activity observed against SW480 cells. Therefore, subsequent studies focused on SW480 cells. In vitro, we observed that Eth arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, decreased MMP levels, elevated cellular ROS levels, and induced mitochondrial apoptosis. In vitro, Eth significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis, and regulated the molecule levels of angiogenesis and inflammatory factors in serum, as well as apoptotic protein in tumor tissues. The serum proteomic revealed that the differential proteins were primarily involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including laminin β1 (Lamb1), and type I collagen (Col1a1). Metabolomics showed that many abnormal levels of metabolites regulated by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were obviously reversed towards normal levels after Eth intervention. The correlation analysis between the two-omics revealed that different proteins in the PI3K/AKT pathway, particularly lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and glutathione synthetase (GSS), can interact with most of different metabolites. In summary, Eth exerts anti-tumour effects by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which in turn activates mitochondrial apoptosis. Eth may be considered in the development of drugs for relieving colon cancer patients in the future.","Meng, Si, Guo, Zhao, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Sun, Feng",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-91251-1

Assessment of the antiproliferative activity of the synthesized compounds against lung (EBC-1), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, AsPC-1 and Mia-Paca-2), colorectal (HT-29), and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells revealed that most of the derivatives possess considerable antiproliferative potential, with IC","Mardaneh, Pirhadi, Mohabbati, Khoshneviszadeh, Rezaei, Saso, Edraki, Firuzi",2025-02-25,10.1038/s41598-025-87483-w
Association between resting heart rate and prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.,"This study aimed to evaluate prognostic value of resting heart rate (RHR) in patients with gastric cancer. We analyzed 1,561 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at Severance Hospital, Korea. RHRs were measured after surgery, and detailed medical, treatment, and lifestyle information was collected. Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between postoperative RHR and prognostic outcomes. During a median of 4 years of follow-up, we identified 174 total deaths, 92 major complications (within 30 days), 186 recurrences, and 106 gastric-cancer-specific deaths. In multivariable-adjusted models, HRs (95% CI) per 10 beats per minute increase in RHR were 1.18 (1.07-1.31) for all-cause mortality, 1.45 (1.33-1.59) for major complication within 30 days, 1.13 (1.02-1.26) for recurrence, and 1.07 (0.93-1.24) for gastric cancer-specific mortality. We consistently observed that higher postoperative RHR is associated with poor prognostic outcomes regardless of demographics, lifestyle, and cancer stage in patients with gastric cancer. In conclusion, an elevated postoperative RHR was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, major complications, and recurrence in patients with gastric cancer. RHR can potentially be used to predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.","Lee, Park, Lee, Giovannucci, Park, Cho, Kim, Hyung, Jeon, Kim",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-89577-x

Development and validation of an Immune-related Gene-based model for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.,"Predicting disease prognosis and the efficacy of immunotherapy presents a significant challenge in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By analyzing transcriptome sequencing data from 69 patients and identifying differentially expressed immune genes, a prognostic index named the immune-related gene prognostic index (IRGPI) was established by Lasso-Cox regression. The IRGPI, which consists of six key genes, was found to be a significant predictor of poor prognosis in patients with high IRGPI scores. The model's predictive accuracy was confirmed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.85, 0.779, and 0.857 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival predictions, respectively. Additionally, patients with high IRGPI scores had increased levels of Treg cells and neutrophils, advanced tumor staging, microvascular invasion grading, and immune checkpoint expression. The IRGPI was also effective in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy in the IMvigor210 dataset, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for assessing patient prognosis and guiding immunotherapy strategies in HCC.","You, Liu, Wang, Zhan, Chen, Chen",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-90183-0

Deep structured learning with vision intelligence for oral carcinoma lesion segmentation and classification using medical imaging.,"Oral carcinoma (OC) is a toxic illness among the most general malignant cancers globally, and it has developed a gradually significant public health concern in emerging and low-to-middle-income states. Late diagnosis, high incidence, and inadequate treatment strategies remain substantial challenges. Analysis at an initial phase is significant for good treatment, prediction, and existence. Despite the current growth in the perception of molecular devices, late analysis and methods near precision medicine for OC patients remain a challenge. A machine learning (ML) model was employed to improve early detection in medicine, aiming to reduce cancer-specific mortality and disease progression. Recent advancements in this approach have significantly enhanced the extraction and diagnosis of critical information from medical images. This paper presents a Deep Structured Learning with Vision Intelligence for Oral Carcinoma Lesion Segmentation and Classification (DSLVI-OCLSC) model for medical imaging. Using medical imaging, the DSLVI-OCLSC model aims to enhance OC's classification and recognition outcomes. To accomplish this, the DSLVI-OCLSC model utilizes wiener filtering (WF) as a pre-processing technique to eliminate the noise. In addition, the ShuffleNetV2 method is used for the group of higher-level deep features from an input image. The convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory network with a multi-head attention mechanism (MA-CNN-BiLSTM) approach is utilized for oral carcinoma recognition and identification. Moreover, the Unet3 + is employed to segment abnormal regions from the classified images. Finally, the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) approach is utilized to hyperparameter-tune the DL model. A wide range of simulations is implemented to ensure the enhanced performance of the DSLVI-OCLSC method under the OC images dataset. The experimental analysis of the DSLVI-OCLSC method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 98.47% over recent approaches.","Alzahrani, Alsamri, Maashi, Negm, Asklany, Alkharashi, Alkhiri, Obayya",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-89971-5

Pan-cancer analysis reveals SMARCAL1 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and poor prognosis in various cancers.,"Although immune checkpoint inhibition in particular has shown promise in cancer immunotherapy, it is not always efficient. Recent studies suggest that SMARCAL1 may play a role in tumor immune evasion, yet its pan-cancer role is unclear. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of SMARCAL1 using TCGA, GTEx, and CCLE databases, evaluating its expression, genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and their clinical correlations across 33 cancer types. Our findings indicate that SMARCAL1 is overexpressed in several cancers, such as Glioma, LUAD, KIRC, and LIHC, impacting prognosis. Elevated SMARCAL1 is linked to poor outcomes in Glioma, LUAD, and LIHC but correlates with better survival in KIRC. We also found significant associations between SMARCAL1 expression and DNA methylation in 13 cancers. Furthermore, SMARCAL1 expression correlates with immune infiltration, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy. This study underscores the need for further research on SMARCAL1 to enhance immunotherapeutic strategies.","Zhao, Wang, Zhao, Zhao, Huang, Lu, Jia, Shi, Liu, Han, Lu, Zhang, Wang",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41598-025-88955-9

Evaluation of blood-tumor barrier permeability and doxorubicin delivery in rat brain tumor models using additional focused ultrasound stimulation.,"Focused ultrasound (FUS) has emerged as a promising technique for temporarily disrupting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-tumor barrier (BTB) to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents. Despite its potential, optimizing FUS to maximize drug delivery while minimizing adverse effects remains a significant challenge. In this study, we evaluated a novel FUS protocol that incorporates additional FUS stimulation without microbubbles (MBs) (""FUS protocol"") prior to conventional BBB disruption with MBs (""BBBD protocol"") in a rat brain tumor model (n = 35). This approach aimed to validate its effectiveness in enhancing BBB/BTB disruption and facilitating doxorubicin delivery.

Insights from a methylome-wide association study of antidepressant exposure.,"This study tests the association of whole-blood DNA methylation and antidepressant exposure in 16,531 individuals from Generation Scotland (GS), using self-report and prescription-derived measures. We identify 8 associations and a high concordance of results between self-report and prescription-derived measures. Sex-stratified analyses observe nominally significant increased effect estimates in females for four CpGs. There is observed enrichment for genes expressed in the Amygdala and annotated to synaptic vesicle membrane ontology. Two CpGs (cg15071067; DGUOK-AS1 and cg26277237; KANK1) show correlation between DNA methylation with the time in treatment. There is a significant overlap in the top 1% of CpGs with another independent methylome-wide association study of antidepressant exposure. Finally, a methylation profile score trained on this sample shows a significant association with antidepressant exposure in a meta-analysis of eight independent external datasets. In this large investigation of antidepressant exposure and DNA methylation, we demonstrate robust associations which warrant further investigation to inform on the design of more effective and tolerated treatments for depression.","Davyson, Shen, Huider, Adams, Borges, McCartney, Barker, van Dongen, Boomsma, Weihs, Grabe, Kühn, Teumer, Völzke, Zhu, Kaprio, Ollikainen, David, Meinert, Stein, Forstner, Dannlowski, Kircher, Tapuc, Czamara, Binder, Brückl, Kwong, Yousefi, Wong, Arseneault, Fisher, Mill, Cox, Redmond, Russ, van den Oord, Aberg, Penninx, Marioni, Wray, McIntosh",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41467-024-55356-x

"Targeting AKT as a promising strategy for SOX2-positive, chemoresistant osteosarcoma.","Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent type of primary malignant bone cancer and currently lacks effective targeted treatments. Increasing evidence indicates that SOX2 overexpression is a primary driver of OS. By screening a small-molecule kinase inhibitor library, we identified AKT as a kinase essential for robust SOX2 expression in OS cells. AKT was found to be frequently overexpressed in OS and positively correlated with SOX2 protein levels. We demonstrated that AKT has no effect on SOX2 transcription but promotes SOX2 protein stability. Mechanistically, AKT binds to and phosphorylates SOX2 at T116, preventing SOX2 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation by ubiquitin E3 ligases UBR5 and STUB1. Moreover, we found that AKT-SOX2 axis is a significant modulator of cancer stemness and chemoresistance and that the combination of AKT inhibitor MK2206 and cisplatin resulted in a synergistic and potent inhibition of OS tumor growth in the PDX model. In conclusion, we identified a critical role for AKT in promoting SOX2 overexpression, tumor stemness, and chemoresistance in OS, and provided evidence that targeting AKT combined with chemotherapy may hold promise for treating refractory OS. Working model showing that AKT stabilizes SOX2 by phosphorylating T116 site. Phosphorylation by AKT restraints the binding and ubiquitinoylation of SOX2 by the UBR5 and STUB1, thus promoting SOX2 stability and tumorigenic activity. Targeting AKT by MK2206 inhibits T116 phosphorylation and promotes SOX2 ubiquitination pathway, which impairs SOX2 tumorigenic activity. A combined treatment with chemo reagent and AKT inhibitor could achieve better therapeutic effect for SOX2-positive OS.","Liu, Kang, Luo, Yang, Wang, Ye, Yang, Wan, Wong, Xiao",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41413-024-00395-9

Endosomal trafficking participates in lipid droplet catabolism to maintain lipid homeostasis.,"The interplay between lipid droplets (LDs) and endosomes remains unknown. Here, we screen and synthesize AP1-coumarin, an LD-specific probe, by conjugating a fluorescent dye coumarin to a triazine compound AP1. AP1-coumarin labels all stages of LDs in live cells and markedly induces the accumulation of enlarged RAB5-RAB7 double-positive intermediate endosomes. The AP1-coumarin-labeled LDs contact these intermediate endosomes, with some LDs even being engulfed in them. When LD biogenesis is inhibited, the ability of AP1-coumarin to label LDs is markedly reduced, and the accumulation of enlarged intermediate endosomes is abolished. Moreover, blocking the biogenesis of LDs decreases the number of late endosomes while increasing the number of early endosomes and inhibits the endosomal trafficking of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and transferrin. Correspondingly, interference with RAB5 or RAB7, either through knockdown or using dominant-negative mutants, inhibits LD catabolism, whereas the expression of a RAB7 constitutively active mutant accelerates LD catabolism. Additionally, CCZ1 knockdown not only induces the accumulation of intermediate endosomes but also inhibits LD catabolism. These results collectively suggest that LDs and endosomes interact and influence each other's functions, and endosomal trafficking participates in the catabolic process of LDs to maintain lipid homeostasis.","Peng, Chen, Ma, Wei, Lin, Xing, Guo, Li, Zhang, Chan, Yen, Zhu, Yue",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41467-025-57038-8

Anti-PD1 based precision induction therapy in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer: a phase II umbrella clinical trial.,"The efficacy and safety of induction-immunotherapy followed by surgery for unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain challenging. In this open-label, single-center, phase II clinical umbrella trial (ChiCTR2000035367), 100 unresectable Stage III NSCLC patients are enrolled. Patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% but contraindications to anti-angiogenic therapy receive immuno-monotherapy. Patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and no contraindications to anti-angiogenic therapy receive immunotherapy plus anti-angiogenesis therapy. Patients with PD-L1 expression between 1% and 49%, contraindications to anti-angiogenic therapy, or negative/unknown PD-L1 expression receive chemoimmunotherapy. The primary endpoint is the major pathological response (MPR) rate. Among 47 surgically-treated patients, the MPR rate is 61.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 46.4%-75.5%), achieving the prespecified endpoint. For secondary endpoints, the objective response rate for all patients is 54.0% (95% CI: 43.7-64.0). The median event-free survival is 29.9 months (95% CI: 17.0-42.7). Most common adverse event is anemia (49.0%). Exploratory transcriptomic analyses reveal Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Antigen 1 (BST1) as a promising biomarker for response to chemoimmunotherapy. Generally, for unresectable stage III NSCLC patients, anti-PD1 based induction-therapy according to PD-L1 expression and contraindication to antiangiogenic therapy followed by surgery is a feasible option.","Yi, Bian, Wang, Hu, Sun, Yan, Wang, Shen, Yu, Yang, Zhou, Liu, Song, Zhu, Zhao, Jiang, Duan, He, Xie, Dai, Zhang, Zhang",2025-02-25,"10.1038/s41467-025-57184-z

Potent and selective SETDB1 covalent negative allosteric modulator reduces methyltransferase activity in cells.,"A promising drug target, SETDB1, is a dual methyl-lysine (Kme) reader and methyltransferase implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative disease progression. To help understand the role of the triple Tudor domain (3TD) of SETDB1, its Kme reader, we first identify a low micromolar potency small molecule ligand, UNC6535, which occupies simultaneously both the TD2 and TD3 reader binding sites. Further optimization leads to the discovery of UNC10013, a covalent 3TD ligand targeting Cys385 of SETDB1.
